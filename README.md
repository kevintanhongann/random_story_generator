## Introduction
This is a sample project to toy around with python code. This is a random story generator that can be extended into more complex use cases.

##TODOs
- Use a larger dataset of text to train the story generator.
- Use more complex patterns to identify in the text.
- Include more detailed descriptions of characters, locations, and events.
- Use a language model to generate more natural-sounding text.
